# myfirstrepozitory - my first ever repository
### This is my first repository, with it I started working on the GIT HUB, in principle, at first I did not understand anything, and then I understood and started working.
# To start...
### ...you need to go to the link https://github.com/APTYOM/myfirstrepozitory.git, find the "clone or download" button and download the project in archive to your desktop.
# Instruments...
### ...there are different ones, but in our case you will need GIT BASH, but in order to download GIT BASH, you need to connect enternet to the apartment and download a browser.
*1) This is GIT for Windows https://git-scm.com/download/win*

*2) Some mysterious enternet browser, but it will work https://www.google.com/intl/ru/chrome/*
# Installation and launch 
### After you have spent the Internet in the apartment, do the following:
*1) Follow the link https://www.google.com/intl/ru/chrome/*

*2) Download and Install the mysterious browser with following the steps of the installation wizard.*

*3) Follow the link https://git-scm.com/download/win*

*4) Download and Install the GIT BASH on your PC*

For my mentors: I allowed myself some humor, but this was all done as part of remembering how the simplified markup language works. In case of incorrect content created by me - I will recreate it.
